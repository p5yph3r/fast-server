# fast-server
FastServer is a shell script which I wrote to save time in CTF's,
I find it very handy..!!!
Feel free to use and edit the code according to your comfort.

# Usage :-
1. Add the files you want to serve in this file (fast-server)
2. chmod a+x fast_server.sh //Give permissions
3. run using 
   /fast_server.sh
# Enjoy ..!!!
